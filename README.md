Choosing the right images and writing Dockerfiles for various applications can seem tricky at first, but with a basic understanding of Dockerfile patterns and common images, it becomes much more straightforward. Let’s go over some guidelines and examples for creating Dockerfiles for different types of applications.

### 1. **Choosing the Base Image**
   - **Frontend Apps (React, Vue, Angular):** Use `node` images since these frameworks often require Node.js to build the app. For production, you can use a web server like `nginx` to serve the static files.
   - **Static Websites:** Use `nginx` or `httpd` for serving HTML/CSS/JS files.
   - **Backend APIs (Node.js, Django, Flask):** Use language-specific images, like `node`, `python`, or `golang`.
   - **Databases (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL):** Use official database images.
   - **CMS (WordPress, Ghost):** Use the official image for the CMS, such as `wordpress` or `ghost`.
  
Here are examples of Dockerfiles for each case:

### 2. **Dockerfile Patterns for Common Applications**

#### Example 1: **React App**
For development, we can use the `node` image to run the development server.

**Dockerfile for Development:**
```dockerfile
# Use the official Node image for development
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json to install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the code
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000 for the React app
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the React development server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

For production, it’s common to build the static files with Node, then use `nginx` to serve them:

**Dockerfile for Production:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Serve the static files with NGINX
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Example 2: **Simple Static Website**
For a static website, `nginx` is commonly used to serve the files.

**Dockerfile for Static Website:**
```dockerfile
# Use the nginx base image
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy static website files to nginx directory
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for web traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Run nginx in the foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Example 3: **Node.js API (Backend)**
For a Node.js API, you can use the `node` image and set up your Dockerfile to install dependencies and start the server.

**Dockerfile for Node.js API:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app files
COPY . .

# Expose API port
EXPOSE 5000

# Start the server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Example 4: **Go Application**
For a Go app, especially if it’s simple, you can build it and run it in a minimal `scratch` image to keep the size small.

**Dockerfile for Go App:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o app

# Run stage - use scratch for a small final image
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/app /app

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the app
CMD ["/app"]
```

#### Example 5: **WordPress Site**
For a WordPress application, use the official `wordpress` image with Docker Compose if you want to add a database service.

**Dockerfile for WordPress:**
Typically, the official `wordpress` image is self-contained, so you don’t need a custom Dockerfile. Just set up with `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db
      WORDPRESS_DB_USER: exampleuser
      WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: examplepass
      WORDPRESS_DB_NAME: exampledb
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: exampledb
      MYSQL_USER: exampleuser
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: examplepass
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
```

### 3. **General Dockerfile Construction Tips**
- **Start Small:** Only install necessary dependencies to keep your image lean and avoid unnecessary layers.
- **Multi-Stage Builds:** Use multi-stage builds (like in the Go example) to build code in one stage and create a minimal image with just the runtime in the final stage.
- **Use `.dockerignore`:** Ignore unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules` or `__pycache__`) with a `.dockerignore` file.
- **Expose Only Necessary Ports:** Define only the ports you need for the service.
- **Use Official Images Whenever Possible:** Official images like `node`, `nginx`, and `wordpress` are regularly updated and secure.

These examples cover a variety of scenarios, and as you gain experience, selecting the right images and writing Dockerfiles will become more intuitive. Let me know if you’d like specific help with any of your applications!
